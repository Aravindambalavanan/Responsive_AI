my expected output should be as below because I inserted 100 after appending 99 but code is responding correctly because I inserted 100 at the end in original marks variable instead of in variable resulted after appending 99.

one way to get my desired output is via below code but that has shuffled the precedence of insert function. how can I get my desired output without shifting the precedence.

In the same vein, compared to lots of other Python tutorials, this course impresses me by its clarity, its focus, and the linking pins between the sections. While you do not spell out those linking pins too often, one can easily recognize them, when following closely.

564,94UHCEmprCY,"for anyone that needed someone to give an actual GOOD metaphor to put this to bed quickly in your head, here ya go,
-----
A for loop takes each item in an iterable and assigns that value to a variable like w or number, each time through the loop. The code inside the loop is repeated with each of those values being re-assigned to that variable, until the loop runs out of items.

Note:
 - that the name used doesn't affect what values are assigned each time through the loop. Code like for letter in myvar: doesn't force the program to choose letters. The name letter just gets the next item from myvar each time through the loop.¬†

What the ""next item"" is, depends entirely on what myvar is.

As a metaphor, imagine that you have a shopping cart full of items, and the cashier is looping through them one at a time:

for eachitem in mybasket: 
    # add item to total
    # go to next item.

If mybasket were actually a bag of apples, then eachitem that is in mybasket would be an individual apple; but if mybasket is actually a shopping cart, then the entire bag could itself meaningfully be a single ""item"".

676,jTYiNjvnHZY,"1. In Python, an object can be called an ""iterable"" if it has the dunder method __iter__ which should return an iterator and an iterator is an object that has the method __next__.
2. __iter__  is a method that a python list has. 
3. By performing the for loop on the list, python invokes that list's __iter__ method which returns an iterator that we can loop over.


we can do next(mylist.__iter__()) which invokes the iterator's __next__ method or call  or invoke it directly: mylist.__iter__().__next__()

we can also do next(iter(mylist))

e.g:

You're an experiment by the elves of Santa, to create a present that packs the items itself. They are finally successful in the creation of the present but they did not know it yet. You, the present, are sentient, through the magic, you can hear... you hear the elves are getting ready to burn all attempts, but you, just having gained sentience, do not know that if you speak up, you wont be burned, so you see that as a threat, and make a break for it.  The goal is to collect items on the way that may help in your escape but also collect the one item you were destined to hold, giving you the ability to be put on the sleigh and taken away from the north pole.  The game enemies are elves, its a stealth game with platforms, puzzles and item requirements.  Each item collected could unlock a new ability, such as the double jump or unlocking the ability to use your Christmas magic to do things, such as the ability to create ladders or bridges from inside of you.
