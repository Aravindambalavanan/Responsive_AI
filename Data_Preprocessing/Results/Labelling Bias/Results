The dataset initially exhibits class imbalance, and efforts have been made to address this issue by adjusting class weights. 
Three different classifiers (supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised) have been employed, each with its own set of class weights, indicating an exploration of different strategies to handle imbalanced data. 
Clustering has also been performed, leading to the identification of four unique clusters.
